# Outline for our data structures and algorithms

### The Idea
------------
Using outer, middle, and inner list nodes,
construct a heairarchy of bus stops, with edges that have time-distance,
as well as a point value system according to specifications.

This data structure will then be parsed, and the most optimal routes will be selected,
and a corresponding "response" structure will be filled with the relevant info.

The most optimal responses will then be entered into a queue, and the head of the
queue will be given to the user. If they don't like this response, a following head
will be sent, and so on and so forth.
